## Your Workspace

This is an R Markdown document. It has the convenience of combining a text editor (like Word or Google Docs) with R for writing and executing code directly in the document. The code sections are distinguished by *chunks* like the one below.

```{r}
1+1
10^3

# Anything in this chunk can be run through R. Unless the line has a '#' in front, this signifies a comment
# Press the green play arrow on the upper right side of this chunk. How much code ran?
# Place your cursor on the 1+1 line and press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter/Return. Now how much code ran?
```

Statisticians use these documents as a workspace for writing, editing, commenting, organizing, and publishing their data analysis. We even create professional looking documents with simple tricks for creating **bold** or *italic* emphasis, among other things. Look for the **Knit** button at the top of the pane, click it and watch RStudio knit text and code seamlessly together.


## Packages

Most often we use these documents to work on code in an organized place. Since R is open sourced, anyone can write their own specialized functions. If we want to use code someone else created, we need to download and install their packages.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# You do not need to run this code today, the packages are already installed in this project
# Once you start your own projects or download RStudio desktop, you will need to run lines like this

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "fivethirtyeight", "infer")) 

# packages only need to be installed once per project on RStudio Cloud and once ever on RStudio Desktop
```


In order to use the functions in those packages, you need to load them into your current session. Most documents with R code have a `setup` R chunk like this at the beginning where they load all of the package they will need.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library("tidyverse") # and writing these lines is not enough, you need to run them first
library("ggplot2")
library("fivethirtyeight")
library("infer")
```

It's not uncommon to have a dozen or more packages loaded right at the beginning of your code.

> Pro-tip: You can name R chunks to distinguish them. And you can suppress all of the loading messages from your knitted document using `include = FALSE`. The code runs, but is not included in the final doc.
